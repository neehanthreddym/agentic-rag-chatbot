# Agentic RAG Chatbot - Hackathon Challenge

## Overview
Build a chatbot (Web App or CLI) that demonstrates how you’d ship an AI-first product feature:
- **File-grounded Q&A (RAG)** with **citations**
- **Durable memory** written to markdown
- *(Optional)* **Safe compute** tool calling with Open-Meteo time series analysis

You may implement one feature or multiple. Partial implementations are acceptable.

---

## Repository Guide (What each file is for)

- Root `README.md` is the submission README (Quick Start + Video link goes here).
- `sample_docs/` is optional sample input data to test ingestion quickly; `sample_docs/README.md` is only documentation for that folder.

- README.md
  Main instructions. You must update the **Participant Info**, **Quick Start** section and paste your **Video Walkthrough** link.

- ARCHITECTURE.md  
  Brief architecture overview (1–2 pages). Explain ingestion, retrieval/citations, memory logic, and optional sandbox.

- EVAL_QUESTIONS.md  
  Example questions you can use to test your bot and to guide your demo/video.

- USER_MEMORY.md  
  Your app must write **selective user-specific memory** here (high-signal facts only).

- COMPANY_MEMORY.md  
  Your app must write **selective org-wide memory** here (reusable learnings only).

- sample_docs/  
  Optional small docs for quick local testing.

- scripts/sanity_check.sh  
  Judge helper: runs `make sanity` and validates output format.

- scripts/verify_output.py  
  Validator for `artifacts/sanity_output.json`.

- artifacts/sanity_output.json  
  This file is generated by `make sanity`. It is required for evaluation.

## Participant Info (Required)
- Full Name: Neehanth Reddy Maramreddy
- Email: neehanthreddym@gmail.com
- GitHub Username: neehanthreddym

## What You Need To Build

### Feature A - File Upload + RAG (Core)
Users can:
- Upload files and add them to a RAG pipeline (parse → chunk → index)
- Ask questions later and receive answers grounded in uploaded content
- Provide **citations** pointing to source chunks/sections

**Minimum expectation:** working ingestion + retrieval + grounded response + citations.

Suggested test data: arXiv PDFs/HTML (open access).

Extra points:
- Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + embeddings), reranking, metadata filters
- Smart chunking (section-aware, semantic boundaries)
- Knowledge-graph flavored RAG

---

### Feature B - Persistent Memory (Core-ish)
Add a memory subsystem that writes selective, high-signal knowledge to:

- `USER_MEMORY.md`  
  Store user-specific facts worth remembering.  
  Example: “User is a Project Finance Analyst”, “Prefers weekly summaries on Mondays”.

- `COMPANY_MEMORY.md`  
  Store org-wide learnings useful to colleagues.  
  Example: “Asset Management interfaces often with Project Finance”, “Recurring workflow bottleneck is X”.

Rules:
- **Selective** (no transcript dumping)
- **High-signal and reusable**
- **Avoid storing secrets or sensitive information**

Implementation hint (optional):
Use an internal decision structure like:
`{should_write, target, summary, confidence}` and only append when confident.

---

### Feature C - Safe Python Sandbox + Open-Meteo (Optional)
Spin up a Python environment using llm-sandbox (or similar isolation) and allow the chatbot to execute an analysis task by calling a public time series API.

Use this API (no key required): Open-Meteo (historical + forecast weather time series).

- **https://open-meteo.com/**

The Chatbot should:
- Call Open-Meteo for a location/time range
- Retrieve time series data
- Compute basic analytics (rolling averages, volatility, missingness checks, anomaly flags, etc.)
- Return a clear explanation of findings

We care about **safe execution boundaries + clean tool interface**, not perfect data science.

---

## Deliverables (Required)
Your repo must include:
- `README.md` with **setup + run instructions**
- A brief architecture overview in `ARCHITECTURE.md` (or in this README)
- A working demo flow (based on what you implemented):
  - Upload → index → ask questions with citations
  - Memory written into `USER_MEMORY.md` and `COMPANY_MEMORY.md`
  - (Optional) Sandbox + Open-Meteo time series analysis
- Basic tests or at least a small sanity-check script (preferred)
- A short video walkthrough (5–10 minutes) demonstrating:
  - The working product end-to-end
  - Key design choices and tradeoffs
  - What you would improve next with more time

---

## Submission Rules (Important)

### 1) Any language / any stack
You may use any language, framework, model, and any vector DB (FAISS/Chroma/pgvector/etc.).

### 2) One universal judge command (Required)
Judges must be able to run:

```bash
make sanity
```

Your `make sanity` must:

* Run a minimal end-to-end flow (based on what you implemented)
* Produce this file:

```text
artifacts/sanity_output.json
```

Judges may also run:

```bash
bash scripts/sanity_check.sh
```

(This script runs `make sanity` and validates the output format.)

### 3) Video Walkthrough Link (Required)

Add your video link here:

## Video Walkthrough

PASTE YOUR LINK HERE

## 4) Important
Submissions missing the Participant Info block may be deprioritized during review.

---

## GitHub Classroom Submission (Required)

### Step 1 — Create your submission repo
1) Open the **GitHub Classroom invite link** provided to you after registration.
2) Accept the assignment.
3) GitHub Classroom will automatically create a **new repository under your GitHub account**.
   - This new repo is your official submission repo.

Important:
- Do **not** submit work in the **agentic-rag-chatbot-template** repository. That is the starter/template repo.
- You must complete your work in the **repository created for you by GitHub Classroom** after you accept the assignment link.
- Only the GitHub Classroom-created repo will be evaluated.

### Step 2 — Work in your submission repo
Clone your Classroom repo and push your commits as usual.

### Step 3 — What you must include before the deadline
In your Classroom repo:
- Fill in the **Quick Start** section in `README.md` (exact run commands)
- Paste your **Video Walkthrough** link in `README.md`
- Ensure `make sanity` works and generates:
  - `artifacts/sanity_output.json`
- Ensure your app writes memory to:
  - `USER_MEMORY.md`
  - `COMPANY_MEMORY.md`

### Step 4 — Final submission
Your submission is automatic once your code is pushed to your Classroom repo.
No separate zip upload is required unless explicitly instructed.

## What We Evaluate

We evaluate holistically:

### Correctness & UX

* RAG answers are grounded and cite sources
* Graceful behavior when retrieval fails (no hallucinations)

### Engineering Quality

* Clean structure and modular design
* Readable code and thoughtful naming
* Error handling and reproducibility

### Product Thinking

* Sensible retrieval design
* Thoughtful memory criteria
* Clear tradeoffs explained in README/architecture

### Security Mindset (Bonus)

* Prompt-injection awareness in RAG
* Sandbox isolation (if implementing Feature C)
* Safe handling of external API calls

## Nice-to-Haves (Optional)

These are optional enhancements. They are not required, but can earn bonus points if implemented well:

- Streaming responses
- Conversation history view
- Multi-user support
- File management tools (re-index / delete / inspect chunks)
- Simple evaluation harness with test questions and expected citations

---

## Quick Start (YOU MUST FILL THIS IN)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

### Setup

```bash
# clone & enter the repo
git clone <your-classroom-repo-url>
cd agentic-rag-chatbot-neehanthreddym

# create virtual environment & install dependencies
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# configure API keys
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and add your GOOGLE_API_KEY or GROQ_API_KEY
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# unit tests only (no API calls)
python -m pytest tests/ -v -m "not integration"

# all tests including integration (requires GOOGLE_API_KEY for gemini-embedding-001 embedding model)
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Run Evaluation

```bash
# evaluate RAG pipeline on TinyLoRA PDF — outputs artifacts/eval_metrics.json
python3 -m scripts.evaluate_pipeline
```

### Run End-to-End Pipeline (CLI)

```bash
python3 -m scripts.test_pipeline
```

### Run Chat UI (Web App)

```bash
make chat
# Opens Streamlit at http://localhost:8501
```

Upload a PDF in the sidebar, then ask questions — answers include expandable citations and automatic memory updates.

### Run Sanity Check (Required for Judging)

```bash
# Run the minimal end-to-end flow and produce artifacts/sanity_output.json
make sanity

# Or run the full validation script (runs make sanity + verifies output format)
bash scripts/sanity_check.sh
```
